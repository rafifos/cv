# Summary

I'm detail-oriented and always strive to write clean, maintainable, and reusable code. I enjoy automating tasks and environments (Bash, Zsh, dotfiles, Docker, etc.).

Graduated in Systems Analysis and Development from Faculdade Impacta, I have experience with Ruby on Rails, JavaScript/TypeScript, and DevOps (containerizing services with Docker, CI/CD pipelines with GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions, and AWS CodeBuild), along with working with AWS, Kubernetes, Helm, and Terraform.

My main stack is JavaScript, TypeScript, Node.js, React, and Next.js.

I'm also active in Android OS communities, where I contribute with investigations, bug fixes, localization, and internal Android components.
